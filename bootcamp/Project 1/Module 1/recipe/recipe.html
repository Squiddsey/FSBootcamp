<p> Whether you scored wild mushrooms at the farmers' market, 
    found cultivated maitake or shiitake at the supermarket
    or just have some baby bellas on hand, 
    this healthy creamy chicken recipe is delicious
    with any of them. Serve over whole-wheat 
    egg noodles or mashed potatoes.
 </p>

 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 five ounce chicken cutlets</li>
    <li>4 cups mixed mushrooms</li>
    <li>&frac12; cup dry white wine</li>
    <li>&frac12; cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
</ul>
    
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Sprinkle chicken with &frac14; teaspoon each kosher salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the chicken, turning once, until browned and just cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes total. Transfer to a plate.</li></br>
<li>Add 1 tablespoon oil and mushrooms to the pan; cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has evaporated, about 4 minutes. Increase heat to high, add wine and cook until it has mostly evaporated, about 4 minutes.</li></br>
<li> Reduce heat to medium; stir in cream, any accumulated juice from the chicken and &frac14; teaspoon each salt and pepper. Return the chicken to the pan and turn to coat with the sauce. Serve the chicken topped with the sauce and sprinkled with parsley.</li></br>


</ol>
<h2>Cooking Tips!</h2>
<p>You can make your own chicken cutlets from two 8- to 10-ounce boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Remove the tenders (the strip of meat on the underside of the breast) and save for another use. Cut each breast in half crosswise. Place between pieces of plastic wrap. Pound with a meat mallet or skillet until about 1/2 inch thick.</p>
