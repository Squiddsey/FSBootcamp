    <p>
        I have been an avid reader since I was a tiny child! I enjoy reading a variety of topics 
        across a variety of mediums, but I primarily enjoy reading books (both fiction and non-fiction) 
        as well as journalist articles. Despite my aforementioned enjoyment of reading since my youth, 
         I lack a clean and tidy list of all-time favorites, but some books I have enjoyed recently include:
         <cite>A Little Life</cite> by Hanya Yanagihara,
         <cite>This Chair Rocks</cite> by Ashton Applewhite, and
         <cite>Normal People</cite>  by Sally Rooney. 
         </p>
         <p class="cleared-left">
         I am currently looking for any surreal recommendations, so if you have any favorites, I would love to hear them!

    <h2>Hiking</h2>
    <img src="./images/hiking.jpg" alt="picture of hikers" class="hiking"/>
    <p>Growing up near the Chattahoochee River, I did not have to venture far from 
        my house to find some lovely trails to hike on. I have always enjoyed going on walks and hikes, 
        and I currently have the great fortune of living near a plethora of trails! My partner and I 
        are currently making our way down a list of various State and National trails nearby, and our 
        favorites so far include the Sweetwater Creek State Park and the Kennesaw Mountain Trails.

<h2>Gaming</h2>
<img src="./images/gaming.jpg" alt="picture of video game controllers" class="gaming"/>
    <p>
        Similar to my other hobbies, I started playing video games from a young age and have not stopped yet! 
        Although I love video games themselves, my favorite part of the hobby is meeting and befriending other
        people. That enjoyment of meeting others is largely the reason that I used to stream video games on Twitch.tv 
        a few years back!
    </p>
    
    <p class="cleared-left">
        These days, I find myself replaying old favorites like Resident Evil 5, Deadly Premonition, or Mario Party 5, 
        but I have played and enjoyed games from almost every genre (aside from Dancing games due to my tragic abilities at dance), 
        and I am always excited to have a friendly discussion about anything video games related!
