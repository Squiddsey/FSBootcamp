This is my final version of the Qwirty website project. It was a fun project, and I learned quite a bit regarding pseudo-selectors, flexbox,
and the process of creating a full website (well, a full website with a single page, that is). There are a few alterations I would make if 
I had more time (and more expertise), such as adding a cool animated border around the 0% Finance button, selecting more interesting fonts, 
and improving the responsiveness of the site overall. Specifically, I initially planned to play with media queries so that when the screen is 
less than 768px, the header consists solely of the search bar and a menu icon, the categories are formated into a row flex-direction and 
laid just underneath the header, and there is only one item card that fits the entirety of the screen (sans header, categories, footer). 
One of my major criticisms of this site is the overzealous usage of Flexbox - there  are likely more elements that are flexboxes (and not
just flex items) than not! But overall, I am pleased with the final version of this site (for now) and am happy to have learned so much.
